# SG-mtDNA server

https://genomics.scripps.edu/mtdna/results/status

Unfortunately, since middle 2019 I do not have access to TSRI's network and thus I can't address any ongoing issues on the server.

## Synopsis

Scripts to submit jobs and retrieve results from SG-ADVISER mtDNA server through the command line.

## Code Example

There are two scripts in <https://github.com/mrueda/SG-Adviser-mtDNA/tree/master/remote>:
 - mtDNALWP.pl (perl mtDNALWP.pl path_to_your_bam/file.bam)
 - mtdna_wget.sh (bash mtdna_wget.sh URL)


## Installation

No installation required
